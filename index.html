    <h2>Verse 1</h2>
    <div>
      <span>It doesn't hurt me.</span> 
      <span>Do you want to feel how it feels?</span> 
      <span>
          Do you want to know
          that it doesn't hurt me?
      </span> 
      <span>
          Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm
          making?
      </span> 
    </div>
    <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
    <div>
        <span>You, it's you and me.</span>
    </div>
    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <div>
      <span>If I only could,</span>
      <span> I'd make a deal with God,</span> 
      <span>
          And I'd get him to swap our
          places,
      </span> 
      <span>Be running up that road,</span> 
      <span>Be running up that hill,</span> 
      <span>
          Be running up
          that building.
      </span> 
      <span>If I only could, oh</span>
    </div>
    <h2>Verse 2</h2>
    <div>
      <span>You don't want to hurt me,</span> 
      <span>But see how deep the bullet lies.</span> 
      <span>
          Unaware I'm
          tearing you asunder.
      </span> 
      <span>Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts.</span>
      <span>Is there so much hate for the ones we love?</span> 
      <span>
          Tell me, we both matter, don't
          we?
      </span> 
    </div>
    <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
    <div>
        <span>You, you and me.</span> 
        <span>It's you and me won't be unhappy.</span>
    </div>
    <h2>Chorus</h2>
    <div>

    </div>
    <div>
      <span>C'mon, baby, c'mon darling,</span> 
      <span>Let me steal this moment from you now.</span> 
      <span>
          C'mon,
          angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling,
      </span> 
      <span>Let's exchange the experience, oh</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span>And if I only could,</span>

          With no
          problems.
